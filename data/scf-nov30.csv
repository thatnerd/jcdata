We are perpetually given ""band aid"" fixes to the issues such as painting ""Stop"" in the street and periodically placing the ""Stop for pedestrians in crosswalk"" signs at the intersection.  Most drivers never stop and many blatantly ignore it. This intersection NEEDS a stop light.  The intersection at Montgomery and Barrow has a stop light. If that intersection deserves a stop light, which is a major 2 way thoroughfare intersecting a one way street on the corner of the park, just like York street and Jersey Avenue.  Why doesn't the Jersey and York street intersection deserve one too? Compounding this problem is the fact that PS 3 & MS4 are right around the corner from the park, making this area an extremely high pedestrian traffic area with children and their guardians.

2623068,Open,Traffic Calming/Pedestrian Safety request,6,"609 Summit Ave Jersey City, New Jersey","The intersection of 139 and Summit Ave is unsafe and needs attention on a number of issues.  It became even less safe for pedestrians when the automatic crossing sign was replaced with a push button sign.   Additionally, the buttons for this sign are so far away from the road that most crossers don't know that they are even present. This leads to pedestrians constantly misjudging the time left in a green light,  and finding themselves trapped in the median.   
While trapped in the median,  they cannot see oncoming traffic because the construction fences have advertisements or posters up on them.   Additionally,  these is nearly zero paint on the road around this crossing and sidewalks on all sides are crumbling into the road.   This intersection is an even greater risk to the disabled,  between the lack of tactile ramps,  shaky grates,  silent and misplaced crossing buttons,  and proximity to the school for the blind.

2644733,Open,Business Complaint,4,"193 Van Vorst St Jersey City, New Jersey","Manhattan Yacht Club has erected a structure on vacant lot without any permits from the Planning Board or the City.
Every night club members consume alcohol and noise is disturbing residents. Per Jersey City Code Chapter 222 the noise shall be restricted to a decibel level of 65 dB from noon to 10 P.M and to 50 dB after 10 P.M. I measured noise with iPhone application and it is at 85 dB peaking to 90-95. Even with windows closed and HVAC on my 5 and 2 years old daughters tell me it is hard for them to fall asleep. My numerous attempts to discuss this situation with the owners and the management did not change anything. I have no problems with the club sailing from the marina, but noisy drunk people and the unapproved ugly structure have to go. Please help to make our neighborhood quite and enjoyable again!



Below are some references to regulations I find relevant.

Per §157-1. 
(2)
Social clubs are expressly regulated by this chapter because recent experience has shown that attempts have been made to circumvent the general regulatory process. (For example, for-profit nightclubs have reorganized as private membership clubs to circumvent the Alcoholic Beverage Law.)

(3) (a) Jersey City seeks to maintain an atmosphere as conducive as possible to families in a densely populated urban setting.

§157-2. The following terms shall have the meanings indicated when used in this chapter:
....
VENUE — Any nightclub or restaurant as defined in Chapter 345 of this Code, including but not limited to a social or private club.
....

Restaurant Entertainment License. This license is available only in zoning districts where a Category 1 Restaurant is permitted pursuant to Jersey City Code Chapter 345 or a duly adopted Redevelopment Plan, except that in the Restaurant Row Overlay Zone (ROZ), a category 2 Restaurant shall also be eligible for this license and except that no entertainment license shall be permitted within the lower J.F.K. Boulevard NC Zoning District.
Class 1 - For Establishments with a capacity greater than one hundred (100) people;
Class 2 - For establishments with a capacity of one hundred (100) people or fewer:
All Restaurant Entertainment Licenses shall be subject to the following:
(a)
Notwithstanding noise regulation in Chapter 222 of the Jersey City Code to the contrary, any entertainment under this Restaurant Entertainment License shall be restricted to a decibel level of 55 dB from Noon to 10 P.M., and shall be restricted to 45 dB from 10 P.M. to close of entertainment in accordance with § 157-4C(1), seven days per week.
(b)
Outdoor entertainment shall be prohibited in all establishments, except where specifically requested in the license application for a certain part of the establishment and approved by the Director and specifically indicated on the actual license. Outdoor entertainment shall not be the norm and shall only be granted where the Director is convinced that it would not unreasonably interfere with the quality of life of the surrounding community. In determining whether or not to grant outdoor entertainment, the Director shall consider, but not be limited to, the following criteria: the nature of the establishment; the location of the establishment including its proximity to residential properties; the input of residents of the surrounding area; and the history (if any) of the establishment. Furthermore, the Director shall not permit outdoor entertainment beyond the hours described in § 157-4C(4).

The location is in Historic District and per Redevelopment Plan
2. Permitted Uses
    c. marina and related uses on the underwater (sic) parcels
3. Accessory Uses:
    d. access to the marina


The plan is very detailed and the regulations apply to all development and are mandatory. Even clubs signage and billboards are not permitted.

Ms. Wilson, became very distraught because the apartment that they gave her was filthy and smelly. She said, the apartment was switched and they wanted her to move into this disgusting apartment that she had never even seen before.

Ms. Wilson had taken a video of the apartment that she said was promised to her and that apartment was APT. 3 F, not  APT. 2 H, that she describes as absolutely disgusting. She said, it is no way that a person is supposed to accept an apartment without ever seeing that apartment, but yet that is what the building manager is trying to do.

2661259,Acknowledged,Parking issues,3,394 Central Ave Jersey City Nj 07307 USA,"For the Office of Mayor Steven Fulop

Dear Mayor Fulop,

I am a citizen of downtown Jersey City. I am writing to you as an aggrieved resident who recognizes all the great work you are doing for the city and who feels Jersey City public service workers should be held accountable for doing their job. 

In this regard, Mr Mayor, I hope you will look into the gross malpractices occurring at the Parking Authority office on Central Avenue, where the workers are incompetent at best and hostile, rude and power-hungry at worst. 

My husband and I visited the office thrice on July 5, 2016 to get a street parking permit, since our 8-unit condominium building has two parking spaces, both of which are owned by other residents. We received a parking permit for the first time in 2015 with no problem whatsoever. When my husband went to renew our permit, however, he was told we were not eligible to get one since our building has parking. He explained that the spots in the building are owned by other residents, and we subsequently followed protocol by providing a letter from our property management company stating that none of the parking spaces are available to us. In return for our cooperation, my husband was accused of fabricating the letter himself and told categorically that he would never be given a parking permit. The first letter by our building management company had not provided all the requisite information so my husband was asked to return with an updated letter. One of the desk clerks at the parking authority saw him emailing the building manager from his phone and for inexplicable reasons decided that my husband was typing up a fresh letter himself, instead of getting one from the building management. When I went to the counter an hour later - with an updated and printed letter from our management company - to reason with her, she told me again that my husband had typed the letter himself (despite it being on the building management company's letterhead), and also announced it to all present (again, for reasons beyond rational understanding). When I told her she was making false accusations, she called security to have me removed from the building. I was carrying my infant child with me. 

So, in sum, my husband and I were harassed and humiliated by an incompetent Parking Authority employee because of her limited understanding of smartphone technology. Mr. Mayor, we fully realize that your time is tied up with greater commitments in service of our wonderful city, but I sincerely hope you will look into making your employees accountable to serving the citizens of this city, instead of being harassers and bullies. We were not asking for special accommodation, only claiming a permit that we are entitled to receive. 

I thank you for reading this letter and congratulate you again for a job well done in making Jersey City a wonderful place to live in.",16276,40.74812581,-74.04794417,"3rd Battalion,Jersey City, NJ (City Boundary),{""Id""=>0, ""Acres""=>380.503, ""CSO""=>""RE-19""},Ward D",07/06/2016 - 10:17AM,07/05/2016 - 04:36PM,07/06/2016 - 10:17AM,07/05/2016 - 04:52PM,07/05/2016 - 04:44PM,TRUE,1060,,Yolanda - RRC,394 Central Ave Jersey City NJ 07307,Parking issues,,,,

When I purchased my house the realtor  informed me that it was possible.  Been leaving  in a hard to park and are getting many tickets.  I love my neighborhood, recently one of my neighbor had my car towed cause it was to close to his driveway.    It's sad and unfair that so many homes in the Heights area have ilegal driveways they can park in front of their homes and don't get ticketed.  When you try to do things the correct way and respect the rules you have the loosing end.  
Please advise me how to proceed.  This has been my 6 attempt to get a respond back from the city of Jersey City.

Not only have recent collisions at Jersey and Mercer occurred, but cars race down the street consistently and pose a danger to pedestrians, animals and property.  Speed humps on Mercer Street would considerably lessen the risk of any future tragedy.

                Water leaked into stair#2 exit corridor and into the sewer room. Possible damage for the base molding.
                No evidence for damage to Kiddie infant room 101 which is currently occupied.
                Floor was dried and dryer was left over night
Solution is required
 
9th st. – water level reached the edge of door 006. Some water leaked inside. No damage was noticed. 
                Need to check the saddle waterproofing. Waterproofing were done already by B&B and by Clara guys. 
                Adam – check if any solution is possible with the city. I know they are working on a new water pipe, perhaps also on a storm system solution.

Today spoke with M Canvin who was very rude and did not agree to curtail the obnoxious alarm.  However the alarm did stop and it is evident the maintenance that is being performed does not require excessive audible testing.

Would appreciate it if the City can contact Alaris  at 201-963-1800 and advise them to keep audible testing to the absolute minimum required to comply with Fire Department regulations.

2772820,Acknowledged,new speed bump is not high enough or wide enough!,3,"176 Ogden Ave Jersey City, New Jersey","We are very pleased by the arrival of the new speed bump this week.  Thank you.  However several neighbors have commented that the speed bump is two low and that it should completely cross the road rather than covering just the center.  I've seen several cars with good suspensions hit the bump traveling at close to 50mph (speed limit is 25mph) and not bottoming out their suspension.  I'm not kidding, 50mph.  In addition non-resident drivers are maneuvering at high speed around the bump if the parking spaces on either side are not occupied.

A speed bump the size of the ones on St. Pauls Ave between JFK and 139 seems to me to be the right idea.  They are high enough and wide enough to discourage miscreant drivers.

We have at least three families with small children immediately past the speed bump and the large number of short-cut-seeking speeders coming through are a grave danger to their safety as well as an overall menace to the neighborhood.

These two young females continue to terrorize the neighborhood by causing a disturbance until police arrive. They at least are breaking the noise ordinance and they are never fined or a ticketed. Secondly they terrorize a senior at 17 Linden Court, by banging on her windows and door trying to get her to come out to start a fight, they are always taunting the senior woman..

These females are allowed to get away with this time after time because they are white. If they were black, they would be ticketed, arrested, and probably assaulted.

Police Officers Excuse for Poor Response:

The Police officers that finally arrived explained that they have people getting shot, which I am not aware of anyone getting shot this morning between 9:30 AM and 10:00 AM. The point is that we cannot not get away with excuses for not paying our taxes, their salaries, nor should they be allowed to make excuses for not servicing the neighborhood. We need leadership in place to handle the workload, bottom line. If this was downtown Jersey City, a car would have been there with-in 5 minutes of the call, not 40 minutes. 

The point is that there are areas of Jersey City that get a quicker response than others. However, in the case of this morning's issue, where you have a block of 12 homes, approximate tax revenue of $60,000 affected by such disturbance, for over 40 minutes, it is unacceptable. I do not know where the training issue or education gap is; however, when police officers or 911/Crime Prevention continue to understand that this is a low-level issue, and comments like ""what do you expect, this the Ghetto"" is acceptable responses, then its leadership at fault here. Is this the same reply that would be made to residents of downtown or Jersey City heights?

Out building started making some 'zzz' noise as well, when the light rail passes by too fast.

I remembered in the board meeting earlier this year, people said someone gonna fix the road each summer... 

No one did it. I saw they fixed Dudley street, where only minor crack.

Could please someone deal with this issue before it's getting too bad? 

Light rail problem is worse and worse. I checked the environment policy. It mentioned that for residential area, there is specific cutoff for the noise. The noise like that is unbearable... Especially the light rail was so loud in midnight... It's 24 hours...

Today it was around 3pm. The dogs wander around up and down the street, bark at people and cars and eat garbage. Once I saw one of the dogs approach a walking-by man and put its paws on him. The gentleman moved the dog away and kept walking. Our neighborhood has a lot of little kids that play on the street and it is extremely dangerous for them as well as everyone else to have these dogs loose on the street. Let along it is illegal not to curb them. My neighbor told the owner of the dogs a couple of weeks ago she'd call the police next time she saw them and took pictures of them, the man apologized but the dogs are still out everyday. It seems the owners let them out to go to the bathroom and run around and then call them back. Those people have to be punished and I hope you'll do your best to see to that.

The landlord has been renting out her attic for years. She had been renting it out to two separate people in the past. Recently, she has rented the apartment to one person (“the attic tenant”). However, she also sleeps in the attic due to the fact that her downstairs apartment is overcrowded.  This is a very old house. I am worried about the health and safety risks. 

There has been extensive flooding, plumbing and electrical issues due to the fact that she has rented out her apartment. 

The attic tenant has been verbally abusive to the landlord. However, I believe that the tenant is aware that the landlord is violating housing law. Therefore, the attic tenant has refused to leave the apartment. The attic tenant flooded his bathroom. The water leak destroyed our ceiling and has created mold. In fact, previous tenants that lived in the attic have flooded the ceiling. 

After weeks of inaction, the landlord is finally fixing our ceiling today. This will be the second time in a year that we have had to fix leaks and remove mold. 

The attic was not originally designed to have plumbing. Yet, the landlord has done extensive work to retrofit the attic with plumbing. In the past, we were forced to share pipelines, causing drastic drops in water pressure. 

There have been major electrical and heating issues because of the extra burden.  The attic has lacked heat and electricity on many occasions. There is also a rodent problem in the house. 

The landlord might not own the house. It appears that our landlord may actually be a tenant, subletting the house. I cannot confirm this.

I have been pressured not to make a complaint. However, I am worried about the health and safety risks. I am worried that there will be more leaking and mold in the future. I am also worried that the overburdened electrical system could cause a fire. 

There are extensive cracks and evidence of prior leaking throughout the house. 

They are currently removing mold and working on the roof.  

I believe that the landlord has rented out her attic, knowingly violating zoning laws for profit.

Is the landlord allowed to rent out the attic? Is she violating zoning or housing law?

What is the procedure for ticketing and how many inches of grass is considered high weed or overgrown grass. I had a court date of sept 9, postponed to oct 13 because I pleaded not guilty. I just need to know the proper procedure for ticketing.

Rarely is there work being done that requires the blocking off of 4 parking spaces.  The permits restricting parking are used for the personal vehicles of the work crew.  This is not specific to this site, but First street is literally coming apart at the seams with traffic and parking strain.  These four spots would go a long way to alleviating the circling, illegal parking and doubleparking that has become the dangerous norm.

Immense amounts of good soil was attached to their roots and thrown out.   The Heuchera may have only been dormant.  Would the city please stop using any miscanthus grass in its landscaping?   It is invasive and competes with native grasses that wildfowl need, and miscanthus seed spreads everywhere.   The reservoir next door is a wetlands preserve where native grass should grow.  Miscanthus pushes them out, and is banned in several states for this.  Its on the DO NOT PLANT list for New Jersey. It was so heavily planted that it is choking some of the new trees out.   The landscaper supplied about twice the number of plants really needed for the area.   The miscanthus is also obscuring the dedication stone to Office Riggi.

Back on May 18th I submitted an inquiry in regards of the light fixture by the alleyway widely used by neighbours and my tenants.  The alleway is really dark at night, and few incidents that happened last couple of months urged us to place this inquiry( robbery, trash dumping, etc). 
Nothing has been done about it, nor did I receive any respond about it. My tenants started to complain again that is very dark, scary and unsafe when they use the garage or go to dump their gartbages. 
However, there is a pole in my backyard that spreads  electricity for the houses nearby. Could anything be done in regards of this issue??
